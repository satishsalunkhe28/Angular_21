	unshift(...items) – adds items to the beginning.
	splice(pos, deleteCount, ...items) – at index pos delete deleteCount elements and insert items.
	toSpliced()   - doesn't change the original array
	slice(start, end) – creates a new array, copies elements from position start till end (not inclusive) into it.
	concat(...items) – returns a new array: copies all members of the current one and adds items to it. If any of items is an array, then its elements are taken.
