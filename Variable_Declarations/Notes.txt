Variables
=========
-in javascript variables can be declared by using eiteh of the below 3 keywords:
    1. var
    2. let
    3. const


      Var                            Let                            const
=================================================================================
1. Since Begining               1. ES_6 (2015)              1. ES_6  (2015)
2. value can be changed         2. value can be changed     2. value cann't be changed
3. not mandatory                3. not mandatory            3. initialization : mandatory
4. Function,global              4. block,function,global    4. block,function,global
5. can be re-declared           5. cann't be re-declared    5. cann't be re-declared
6. TDZ - No                     6. TDZ - Yes                6. TDZ - Yes




Variable Scopes:
===============
1. Global : declared outside a function , can be accssed by any of the functions inside a subscriptions
2. Function : declared inside a function , can be accssed only inside that function
3. Block : declared inside a Block , can be accssed only inside that Block (if, else, loop)

Note : if a variable is declared without var/let/const , its scope is always 'global'
-It's not recommended to declare variables without var/let/const


Strict
======
Noraml : Few mistakes are ignored
Strict : mistakes are considered as errors
-'use strict' is used to enable strict mode
1. strict mode doesnt allow to declare variables without var/let/const
2. duplicate parameter not allowed






How Javascript Code Gets Executed
=================================
-When a javascript program runs, 1 Global Execution Context(anonymous) is created
-For Every Function Call, a new Function Execution Context(f1,f2,f3) is Created
-Execution Context = Environment in which code gets executed
-Each Execution Context has 2 phases:
    1. Memory Creation Phase (memory gets allocated for variables and functions)
    2. Code Execution ( variables are initialized with actual value, functions are invoked)


Hoisting
========
-Its a mechanism where variables and functions are moved to the top of their scope
-It allows to access only var type variables before initialization
-During memory phase though var/let/const everything is hoisted(present in memory),
 only var type variables are initialized with undefined value


Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
========================
-The state where variables are un-reachable 
-They are there in memory, but they are not usable
-let/const variables even though they are present in memory we cannt use them 
 as long as they are not initialized with actula values(10/20)
